# Customer Churn Analysis - Capstone Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This capstone project analyzes customer churn patterns to help businesses identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies. Using real customer data, we built predictive models and generated actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

**Business Problem:** High customer churn rates (20%+) lead to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs. Understanding churn drivers is critical for business sustainability.

**Objective:** Identify key factors driving customer churn and develop a predictive model to enable proactive retention strategies.

- **Model Accuracy:** 85%+ prediction accuracy using Random Forest  
- **Key Findings:** Tenure and monthly charges are strongest churn predictors  
- **Potential Impact:** 15–20% reduction in churn through targeted interventions
